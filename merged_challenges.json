A small group of cryptographers were confident enough in it to write a paper and publish it. But at the same time, the cryptanalysis is constant-time and can be done with undergrad-level number theory. This makes it an attractive CTF problem, in my mind. The system is as follows: KeyGen(): Generate two safe primes p, q for an RSA modulus N=pq. Set Phi(N) = (p-1)(q-1).  Choose x, a random even integer greater than zero and less than Phi(N).  Choose g, a generator of Z/NZ.  Return: Master public key = { N, g, g^x (mod N) } Master private key = { p, q, x }.  IssueKey(Master private key, Decrypter name): With a public hash function, compute n (an odd integer greater than zero and less than N) as the hash of the decrypter's name.  Return: Decrypter private key = { 1/(x+n) (mod Phi(N)) }.  Encrypt(Master public key, Decrypter name, Message): With the same method as IssueKey, compute n as the hash of the decrypter's name.  Choose r, a random integer greater than zero and less than N.  Compute K = g^r (mod N) and A = (g^x * g^n)^r.  Compute C = Encrypt_K(Message) Return: Ciphertext = { A, C }.  Decrypt(Decrypter private key, Ciphertext): Compute K = A^(1/(x+n)) (mod N).  Return: Decrypt_K(C).  We give somebody the master public key, a ciphertext encrypted to A, and decrypter keys for B, C. The challenge is to decrypt the message to A.",

To generate a challenge, let's assume secret S which participant wants to capture is represented as a 64-byte string of bytes. It could be a secret password, string FLAG repeated 16 times or URL. It must have a length of exactly 64-bytes.  Following components are generated: * RSA/1536 keypair, with public exponent e=3 and modulus N. The key can be encoded to PEM format to make challenge look more realistic.  * Random 512-bit number K from a range `N^(1/3)<K<(2N)^(1/3)`.  Afterwards we encrypt K with a RSA public key and convert result to big-endian octet string (Y=K^e mod N). The string will be 192 bytes long.  Finally we XOR Y octet string with secret S, C=Y xor S (there may be an information in a challenge, which says that XOR was used as symmetric cipher).  This is easily breakable. The key is to notice that a) there is no padding, b) by construction Y+N is a perfect cube, whose root is K (K^3 == Y+N)",
